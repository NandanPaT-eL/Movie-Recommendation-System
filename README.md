## üß† Introduction

This project is a hybrid movie recommendation system built with Python. It leverages machine learning techniques to recommend movies to users by analyzing either movie metadata or collaborative viewing patterns. The system includes:

- Content-Based Filtering: Recommends movies similar in genre, keywords, cast, etc.
- Collaborative Filtering: Suggests movies based on the ratings of similar users.
- A simple GUI interface for user-friendly interaction.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Python 3.x**
- **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **scikit-learn**
- **Surprise** (for collaborative filtering)
- **Tkinter** (for GUI)
- **Jupyter Notebooks** (for development and prototyping)

## üîç Recommendation Approaches

### 1. Content-Based Filtering

- Utilizes metadata like **genre**, **director**, **cast**, and **keywords**.
- Cosine similarity is calculated between movie vectors created from combined features.
- Suggests similar movies to the one a user likes.

> Implemented in: `/Content based`

### 2. Collaborative Filtering

- Based on user-item interactions.
- Matrix factorization using the **SVD algorithm** from the `Surprise` library.
- Recommends movies based on similar users' preferences.

> Implemented in: `/Colaborative Filtering`
